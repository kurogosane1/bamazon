Welcome to an application that is an alternative and most probably a futher alternative to amazon.
I'd like you to meet bamazon

The application begins by requested your purpose which is to either buy or do nothing.

if the user wants to buy, then the user is then shown a list of items that are available

the user is then asked for the item_id that the item that they would like to buy and also the how many would they like to buy.
The system would then check to see if there is enough items in stock to purchase. If the items are less the user shall be prompted insufficient quantity

otherwise the system then would update the quantity
